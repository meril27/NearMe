            Chothavilai Beach, lying on the West Coast in Kanyakumari District, Tamil Nadu, has a long sandy beach extending over a km, which is an attraction for beach walkers. It is one of the cleanest beaches in the district as it is a little away from human habitation and not very much frequented by tourists, and hence a haven for children who wish to enjoy building sandcastles.
            For the adults who boast of their stamina, it offers shallow waters and not-so-frightening waves to try swimming. An exquisite sight would be seeing off the sun at the horizon. The sand dunes dividing the beach and the road are awesome. In short, it is a great getaway for those who love a quiet retreat with family.
