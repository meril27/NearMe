            Many are unaware of the Mangrove Forests in kanyakumari district. Some enterprising individuals apparently planted the trees more than two decades ago and it is only now that the forest department and 
            district administration are showing interest in fencing and developing the mangrove wetlands. This forest support diverse groups of flora and fauna and attain special significance because of their location 
            on the Central Asian Flyway of migratory waterbirds. Situated as it is at the tail end of this flyway, these wetlands are among the southern most wintering grounds for migratory ducks and shorebirds that 
            breed in Northern Asia and migrate thousands of miles in autumn to milder climates in the south.
