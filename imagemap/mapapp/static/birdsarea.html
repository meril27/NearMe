            Many species of birds migrate to this area around a specific time of the year. Many bloggers, bird-photographers, and many tourist often come here to view them and click pictures. It looks quite like an little birds sanctuary.
            Ebirding also takes place here. Ebirding refers to gather the information in the form of checklists of birds, archive it, and freely share it to power new data-driven approaches to science, conservation and education. Birds usually migrate ther at the time of spring and winter seasons.
